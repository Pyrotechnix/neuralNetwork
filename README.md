Simple MLP neural network currently being built to train on a dataset of 28*28 images.

Specifications:
- Using ReLU activation
- Using softmax and multiclass cross entropy loss for last layer and cost function
- Using NumPY for calculations
- Currently has 1 hidden layer of 100 neurons
- Achieved 95% test accuracy on unseen data using MNIST dataset
